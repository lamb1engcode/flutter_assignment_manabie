## Assignment Manabie

### How I can run it?
- Step 1: Clone repository
- Step 2: Run below command in your terminal for setup environment & project:
```terminal
flutter pub get
cd ios
pod install
```
- Step 3: Run below command for test:
```terminal

### Note:

I thought Manabie wanted to see code style and adaptability so I made a basic todo app, applying TDD and redux (this is my first time using redux, my strengths are BLoC and GetX).
